# Class-Test
My one hour game jam game about doing a class test

Original game available [here](https://hannah-rose.itch.io/class-test).

Use this code or anything else here at your own peril.
SVG in the top level directory is where I made all the art assets for the game. If it's not loading in your program of choice, try Inkscape!

Do whatever you want with this, let me know if it helped you in any way! Credit is not necessary, but always appreciated.

No liscence on this or anything, honestly if you manage to sell it I'd be impressed.
